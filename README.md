# rt-ngx-color

This project is to develop and test new Angular12-based rt-ngx-color library.

**This project is supposed to be in _angular12_ branch only. This is totally different project(Angular12) from _master_ branch(Angular.js). NEVER merge this into _master_ branch.**

## Development server

Run `yarn start` for a lib-testing dev server 

## Build

Run `yarn build-lib` to build the library. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
